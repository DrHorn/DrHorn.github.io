<h1>Currently</h1>
<h2>Main Activity</h2>
<p>I am currently a Senior Research Officer at the Institute for Social and Economic Research (ISER) at the University of Essex within the Understanding Society team. I am currently involved with survey methods and approaches to high frequency data collection, experiments within the Undersanding Society Innovation Panel, and research into remote data collection for activity patterns. My previous work with the ESRC-funded initiative (led by Dr Laura Piacentini and Dr Gavin Slade,	with a team spanning three countries - <i>In the Gulag's Shadow</i>) explored decarceration trends across former Soviet states and the ramifications of the legacy of the Gulag as regards trends in punitive policy and sentiments. I am interested in research topics which explore the hard-to-reach and hard-to-engage populations, survey response burden to sensitive/cognitively 'heavy' items, spatial analyis with survey studies, and the intersections of social protection policy and punitiveness. </p>

<p>I have led on, and assisted with, several international development projects with local and international NGOs across Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe, and Central Asia. In addition to my academic interests, I am particularly interested in participating in projects that focus on capacity building towards enabling communites to adequately address social and economic issues with comprehensive statistical and evidence-based advocacy.</p>
